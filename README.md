# AI-Powered Size Chart Generator

This project is an AI-powered size chart generator that uses a combination of an AI agent and traditional machine learning (ML) techniques. The aim is to optimize and update apparel size charts based on user body measurements, previous purchase history, and return/exchange information.

## Project Overview

The project consists of two main components:
1. **Agent**: An AI-driven module responsible for generating SQL queries based on a given size chart and database schema. It retrieves the relevant data from the database and processes it for further analysis.
2. **Clustering Technique**: A custom clustering module that analyzes the data to determine the optimal number of clusters (K) and then updates the size chart with probabilistic values derived from the clusters.
